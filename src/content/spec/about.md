# About
Hey there, I am Fauzan. Internet knows me as Southerntw. 

I write my thoughts here. They can consist of many things: sports, games, music, or tech. Whatever it is, it should be what I'm thinking at the moment. Pretty random, I'd say, but at least you will know what I'm up to.

My business card says AIoT Engineer, which is just a fancy way of saying I teach machines to be smart so humans can be lazy. But hey, someone's got to build the future where your toaster judges your breakfast choices. Might as well be me.

Wanna give me a job? Check out my LinkedIn page first. The button should be around here, look for it yourself.
